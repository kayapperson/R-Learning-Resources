# R-Learning-Resources
For those who aspire to learn R and data science.

This content is designed for audience with little to no Machine learning knowledge. It starts from R programming basic to R Server or even Spark R if you wish. Thanks for your support and feedback to make this content better. 

### **Learning R online resources:**
1.  R Programming Basic: Use [DataCamp Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) (Free) to learn the basics of R. 

2.  R in data analysis (data pre-processing, feature engineering, and beginners' predictive analytics): 
2.1 [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-r-data-science-microsoft-dat204x-5)
2.2 [A blog post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-scratch/)

3.	[R Server on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-big-data-microsoft-r-server-microsoft-dat213x-1) (highly recommended).

### **Go above and beyond**
[From R open & R Server to predictive analytics with Spark](https://www.edx.org/course/implementing-predictive-analytics-spark-microsoft-dat202-3x-1) (highly recommended).

### **Setting up R engines and IDE (authoring tool) on a local computer or a VM:**
1.  [Download VS2015 community with R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/rtvs/) (two downloads VS and RTVS from one link).

2.  Set VS2015 using Data Science Settings to make it look and feel the way data scientists use R IDEs. 
2.1 After the installation of RTVS on VS, go to the R Tools tab --> Data Science Settings. Just click on it to activate the setting of VS.

3.  [Download R open for Windows](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/): (or from any of [the CRAN mirrors](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) near you.)

4.  [Download SQL Server 2016 Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/application-development) to install R Services (SQL Server Engine is not required to run R Services).

RTVS will allow you to switch from one R engine to another including a remote HDI Spark R or R Server on a remote server, e.g. on a SQL Server box.
